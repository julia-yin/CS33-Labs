/*
 * Implementation of malloc with an explicit free list aka a doubly linked list of free blocks
 * using first-fit search. My implementation is adapted from the textbook's implementation of
 * an implicit list with the majority of the macros and helper functions referenced from the
 * textbook. I altered it so that an explicit free list is used instead for better performance.
 *
 * Each allocated block consists of a 4-byte header and footer that store the block's size and
 * allocation status, along with the payload. Each free block consists of a 4-byte header and
 * footer storing the size and allocation status, along with 4-byte next and previous pointers
 * that help form the explicit free list of free blocks. Thus, the minimum block size is 16 blocks,
 * as each free block must be at least 16 bytes to store the header, footer, and pointers.
 * 
 * My implementation uses a pointer to the start of the free block list to help traverse.
 * Each free block is connected to the next and previous blocks on this list via 4-byte
 * pointers stored in the payload area of each free block. When a block that "fits" an allocation
 * request is found, it is then removed from the explicit free list by updating the next and
 * previous pointers of the blocks directly next to it. When a block is added to the free list,
 * it is added to the very beginning of the list, and the start pointer is updated accordingly.
